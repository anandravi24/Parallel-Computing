Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04

Problem 1a: Naive Multiplication
Number of Runs : 5
Average execution time = ( 1408 + 1351 + 1372 + 1508 + 1397) / 5 = 1407 sec = 1.41e+12 ns
Average performance = ( 97.6 + 101 + 100 + 91 + 98) / 5 = 97.52 MFLOPS/sec

Problem 1b: Block Matrix Multiplication

Case 1 : Block Size = 4
Number of Runs = 2
Average execution time = ( 575 + 560 ) / 2 = 567.5 Seconds
Average performance = ( 245 + 273 ) / 2 = 259 MFLOPS/sec

Case 2 : Block Size = 8
Number of Runs = 2
Average execution time = ( 502 + 504 ) / 2 = 503 Seconds
Average performance = ( 273 + 272 ) / 2 = 273.5 MFLOPS/sec

Case 2 : Block Size = 16
Number of Runs = 2
Average execution time = ( 496 + 498 ) / 2 = 497 Seconds
Average performance = ( 277 + 275 ) / 2 = 276 MFLOPS/sec
